        <p>This drawing is part of my Deep Thinkers series, in which various animals are juxtaposed with evidence of human thought, in the form of mathematical equations, quotes, definitions, musical scores, etc. These pieces approach the topic of nature in art by depicting a zen-like transcendent bridge between conceptual thinking and animalistic consciousness. These two contrasts are united by a careful use of color and decorative design. This piece depicts a frog in front of a series of black hole equations.
This drawing depicts one way of approaching the topic of nature in art. My Cosmic Frog drawing ties together earthly, amphibious life with cosmic, universal calculations - thus combining something small and recognizable with grand concepts that are abstract and intangible to our human consciousness. Frogs and black holes - makes for an interesting contrast!

        <p>Most sunsets use a variety of shades of orange, yellow, blues and purples, along with sienna and black. ... When painting a sunset on the water, the colors present in the sky will be reflected in the water. The sun should always be painted with pure, brilliant color and then adding darker colors to surround it. </p>

        <p>ARTIST:Leonardo Da Vinci </p>
        <p>[7]	Painted between 1503 and 1517, Da Vinci’s alluring portrait has been dogged by two questions since the day it was made: Who’s the subject and why is she smiling? A number of theories for the former have been proffered over the years: That she’s the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo (ergo, the work’s alternative title, La Gioconda); that she's Leonardo’s mother, Caterina, conjured from Leonardo's boyhood memories of her; and finally, that it's a self-portrait in drag. As for that famous smile, its enigmatic quality has driven people crazy for centuries. Whatever the reason, Mona Lisa’s look of preternatural calm comports with the idealized landscape behind her, which dissolves into the distance through Leonardo’s use of atmospheric perspective.

        <h2>Girl with a Pearl Earring</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>ARTIST: Johannes Vermeer</p>
        <p>Johannes Vermeer’s 1665 study of a young woman is startlingly real and startlingly modern, almost as if it were a photograph. This gets into the debate over whether or not Vermeer employed a pre-photographic device called a camera obscura to create the image. Leaving that aside, the sitter is unknown, though it’s been speculated that she might have been Vermeer's maid. He portrays her looking over her shoulder, locking her eyes with the viewer as if attempting to establish an intimate connection across the centuries. Technically speaking, Girl isn’t a portrait, but rather an example of the Dutch genre called a tronie—a headshot meant more as still life of facial features than as an attempt to capture a likeness. </p>

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>ARTIST: Vincent van Gogh</p>
        <p>Vincent Van Gogh’s most popular painting, The Starry Night was created by Van Gogh at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, where he’d committed himself in 1889. Indeed, The Starry Night seems to reflect his turbulent state of mind at the time, as the night sky comes alive with swirls and orbs of frenetically applied brush marks springing from the yin and yang of his personal demons and awe of nature.

He made this painting while he was in Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Remy-de-Provence, France, before his death in 1890. He started this painting within one week when he was admitted to an asylum. He named this painting “The lightning conductor for my illness” because he felt that continuing painting keep himself secured from going insane.
